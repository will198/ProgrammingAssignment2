## This function create a special matrix object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This function calculate the inverse of a squared matrix cached by makeCacheMAtrix
## function. If the inverse has already calculated, then the function retrive
## the inverse, instead of doing the calculation.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
